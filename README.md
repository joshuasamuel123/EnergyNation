# Energy Nation — MPI Project Risk Intelligence

---

## Overview
EnergyNation offers data-driven tools to evaluate the probability of construction (within 3 years), urgency (time-to-event priority), and power ranking of major infrastructure projects in Canada. The repository integrates a cleaned MPI datasets, two complementary risk engines (a Bayesian scorecard and a Cox proportional hazards model), an interactive dashboard, and supporting papers.
